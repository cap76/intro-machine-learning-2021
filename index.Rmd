# About the course 

Machine learning describes a series of data-driven algorithmic approaches that simulate the “learning without being explicitly programmed” paradigm. These methods are particularly useful when limited information is available about the structure or properties of a dataset; also, real-world data rarely follows a well-defined mathematical distribution (due to technical variation in measurements, noise, etc) – assumption-free models offer flexibility for this type of input with the side effects of underlying characteristics of the dataset (e.g. through feature selection). The term “Machine Learning” encompasses a broad range of approaches in data analysis with wide applicability across biological sciences. Lectures will introduce commonly used approaches, provide insight into their theoretical underpinnings and illustrate their applicability and limitations through examples and exercises. During the practical sessions students will apply the algorithms to real biological data-sets using the R language and RStudio environment. All code utilised during the course will be available to participants.

## Prerequisites

Participants should be experienced in programming in R as the course will build on this. We recommend the [Introduction to R for biologists](https://training.csx.cam.ac.uk/bioinformatics/course/bioinfo-introRbio) course as a first course to start programming in R. If you are not able to attend an introductory course, please work through the [R material](https://cambiotraining.github.io/intro-r/) as a minimum.
